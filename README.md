# Calculator
[Live Demo](https://devansh-baghel.github.io/calculator/)

This is my solution for [TOP's Calculator Project.](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-calculator)

## Todo
- [x] Basic HTML
- [x] Basic Styling for now (to be improved later)
- [x] Make it work somehow with js .? idk...
- [x] Clean all the old dirty code with newer dirty code
- [x] Allow user to repeatedly calculate without having to refresh the page
- [x] Make it so that calculator should not evaluate more than a single pair of numbers at a time.
- [x] Make sure text doesn't overflow with too many numbers
- [x] Make sure user can't enter more than one operator
- [x] Make sure user can't divide by 0
- [x] Add a 'clear' button
- [x] Add a backspace support
- [ ] Make sure user can't hit submit directly after an operator
- [ ] Make sure user can enter double 00, strict mode in eval prevents this
- [ ] Just use mathjs api
- [ ] Add decimal support
- [ ] Add keybord support
- [ ] Improve Styling
- [ ] Add a '%' button
